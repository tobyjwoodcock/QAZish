Building a handwired QAZ style keyboard

The QAZ is a 35% staggered keyboard designed by tominabox1 and whydobearsxplod sold by Coffee Break Keyboards.

I have wanted to build a QAZ since I first saw a picture of one on the 40% subreddit. Unfortunately PCBs are out of stock and shipping from CBK in the US to me in the UK would cost way more than the price of the PCB itself.

The natural solution to this is therefore to handwire my own.

The process:
- Figure out the layout
- Design a Case
- Buy the parts
- Build it
- Write the firmware


The Layout

I used http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ to create the layout for the QAZ. This a very useful site for designing custom keyboard with tools for creating and arranging keys in your ideal layout and providing you with some raw data that can be sent to other sites.

To start the process of designing the case, I took the data from KLE and imported it to the plate generation site http://builder.swillkb.com/. This site will produce a DXF file that you can download and use for manufacturing. They also provide a direct link to have your plate manufactured for you by Lasergist, if you do not own a lasercutter/3D printer.

As I have access to a 3D printer I simply downloaded the file and brought it into Fusion360 to start designing the case.


Designing the case

For simplicity, I decided to use an integrate plate style of case. This meant that I would only have to print a singular main piece that I could build the board around.

Swillkb date brought into Fusion gives me a base to work on: switch spacing is already correct and the holes are all the correct size.

Starting with my base from swillkb this is what I came up with. The case has a 6 degree tilt and uses a 5mm plate with cutouts around the mounting clips of the switches giving the plate a thickness of 1.5mm in those areas.
